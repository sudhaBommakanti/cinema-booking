# cinema-booking
A prototype for a web site, where visitors should be able to:
Get information about movies shown, incl. dates and times.
See trailers for the movies
Book their movie tickets online - and find out the total price, placements (row and chair no.) And booking number.
Log in and see their bookings (both history and upcoming).
To run the project first write npm install and then nodemon or node index in the editor
